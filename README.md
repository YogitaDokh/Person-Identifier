## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

3. Enroll people:
   ```
   python -m app.scripts.enroll 
   ```

4. Build gallery embeddings:
   ```
   python -m app.scripts.build_gallery
   ```

5. Run pipeline on a video or camera:
   ```
   python run_pipeline.py [video_path]
   ```

6. Launch dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
